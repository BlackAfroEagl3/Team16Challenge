# Team16Challenge
Repo for 2023 Hackathon 
So far the procedure goes like this(do not include this proffessionally)
We cover three events 1. Harvest 2. Chill produce  3. Ship the produce
Questionable line - Using 2 RFID tags the first during harvest and the second when shipping the produce
Our app that we create is supposed to display 2 options at each event for the farmer

Harvest 1. New - is intended to create a new barcode each time for the farmer(is a placeholder since we cannot do that(ALEX YOU FIX THIS LATER)
Harvest 2. Demo - Displays a RFID barcode that is used throughout all three events displays (Location, description of Commodity, Quantity and unit of measure of the food, Location description for the farm where the food was harvested
